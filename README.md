# Kanguru

Kanguru is a social commerce platform that allows individuals ("Affiliates") to sell products in exchange for commissions. Unlike the traditional catalog sales model, in Kanguru, Affiliates only need to find customers, as Kanguru takes care of the rest.

The products available on the platform are posted by third-party sellers ("Suppliers"). They invest in sourcing the products, storing their inventory, and when they receive an order from Kanguru, they dispatch the product to the end customer.
Below is an image illustrating how it works when an Affiliate places an order on Kanguru.

# Tech Stack

**Front-end:**

React JS, Bootstrap 5

**Back-end:**

Firebase Hosting, Firebase Cloud Firestore, Firebase Cloud Functions, Node JS, Express

**Integrated APIs:**

99 Minutos, SendGrid, Twilio, Algolia, Stripe

**Indexing Optimization:** 

To optimize the platform, we used Algolia, a specialized service for extremely efficient indexing. As a result, our application can search for information very quickly.

Algolia maintains a copy of our database, which is automatically updated whenever our Firebase database changes. To retrieve data, our system makes calls to Algolia, allowing us to obtain information from the database without the need to perform reads directly from our Firebase database.
